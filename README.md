## [Introduction](#top)

My name is Inon Sharony, and I am a doctoral student in Professor Avraham [Nitzan](http://atto.tau.ac.il/~nitzan/nitzan.html)'s group at [TAU](http://www.tau.ac.il).  
I graduated my B.Sc. studies in 2007, majoring in Chemistry with Physics as a minor subject.  
My particular area of interest within our group is heat conduction through molecular wires.

![Metal-Molecule-Metal junction (Quantum transport at the molecular scale quantrans.org)](MetalMoleculeMetal.jpg)  

This is a schematic of a molecular junction of the type our group deals with. We study transport through the molecular bridge between two contacts. The transport may be of an electrical current or of heat, for example. In the instance shown above, the molecular junction operates as an electronic switch (M. Reed, et al., Science 1999).

## [Experiments](#top)

![Experimentalists](muppetlab.jpg)  

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"All science is either physics or stamp collecting."</span> -- Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron of Nelson (father of nuclear physics) quoted in "Rutherford at Manchester" (1962) by J. B. Birks.
*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment."</span> -- also attributed to Rutherford.
*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"Experimental confirmation of a prediction is merely a measurement. An experiment disproving a prediction is a discovery."</span> -- attributed to Enrico Fermi.

## [Teaching](#top)

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."</span> -- John von Neumann, quoted in "The Dancing Wu Li Masters" (1984) by Gary Zukav.
*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"Mathematics is the only good metaphysics."</span> -- William Thomson, 1st Baron of Kelvin, quoted in E. T. Bell, Men of Mathematics, xvii.
*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">Math books are studied by physicists for the same reason the lawbook is studied by criminals.</span> -- paraphrasing Professor Roman Mints.
*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"There is no rigorous definition of rigor."</span> -- Morris Kline, "Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty," p. 315, (1982).

In spring semesters since 2009, I was the lead lab instructor for the [Computational Chemistry Laboratory](http://www.tau.ac.il/~ephraim/complab.html), under Associate Professor Ephraim Eliav.  
My responsibilities included delivering frontal lectures to the entire class, leading interactive teaching sessions, instructing lab groups (as well as grading their preparatory exercises and final reports), personally evaluating students within my lab group, developing lab exercises, maintaining the lab manual, and composing and grading quiz questions.  
Since I began instructing in the lab, we have had multiple requests by research group heads and their students from other universities to have students enroll in our course, as they have found it uniquely adapted to their research needs.  
Additionally, student demand had outrun lab accommodations three years in a row.  
During the time in which I have been an instructor in the Computational Chemistry Lab, I've learned a great deal, both with regard to the management and leadership of an instruction team, and with regard to the course material itself.  
I've tried to put an emphasis on the specific research interests of the students, and on how the Computational Chemistry Lab can give them the necessary tools for these applications.  

*   <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #fff">"In your letter you apply the word _imponderable_ to a molecule. Don't do that again."</span> -- James Clerk Maxwell FRS FRSE in a September 1874 letter to Lewis Campbell, quoted in Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, "The Life of James Clerk Maxwell," p. 391 (1882).  

    In fall semesters since 2009, I was the senior recitation master for the course [Thermodynamics](http://www.tau.ac.il/~hdiamant/teaching//2011/thermo/), under Professor Haim Diamant.  
    As such, my responsibilities included delivering weekly two-hour frontal lectures, personally tutoring students, synchronizing the recitations with the Professor's lectures, maintaining the existing TA guide and producing new modules, and assisting the Professor with the preparation and administration of the final exam.  
    The relatively long time during which I've held this position has afforded me the opportunity to acquire and hone my teaching skills, as well as improving my fundamental understanding of the course material and related topics.  

    In the 2013 spring semester I was the instrutor of the [Molecular Dynamics computer experiment](http://www.tau.ac.il/~physchem/Dynamics) at the Advanced Laboratory in Physical Chemistry.  
    I recieved the experiment in a decrepid condition -- it was not revamped since its inception in 2001\. Building on my past teaching experience, I gathered all the relevant material I could find and consolidated a new laboratory manual. The experiment was bolstered by adding new modules which give the students their first experience in applying such varied methodologies as mathematical modeling, random processes, probability & statistics, numerical methods (e.g. for differentiation & integration), statistical mechanics, and computational chemistry.

    Superquadric tensor glyphs can be used to conveniently visualize any symmetric 3D second-order tensor (i.e. symmetric 3D matrix), [as suggested by Kindlmann](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/papers/vissym04/). I was first introduced to the concept of tensor ellipsoids by [Prof. Lev Vaidman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vaidman) while taking [his course on Analytical Mechanics](http://www.tau.ac.il/~quantum/Vaidman/AM.html), in which he used such glyphs to depict the angular inertia tensor. See also the discussion of the dielectric tensor in Landau & Lifshitz's "Theory of Elasticity".  

    ![mass-energy equivalence in accelerators](mass-energy_equivalence_in_accelerators.gif)  
    Physicists are very clever people. When they want to find out what something is made of, they take two of the thing and crash them together, much as a toddler would two toy trucks. When pieces fly off, they look at what originally consisted the particles they collided. The Mass-Energy equivalence shows up in particle accelerators much as this drawing depicts -- the kinetic energy that the original particles were endowed allows for particles heavier than the originals to be created, while the products carry less momentum.
